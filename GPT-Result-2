<<Prompt>>====================================================

Like the following puzzle, create a new different puzzle to move five animals and things.  
And provide a solution.
 
The Puzzle:
A man has to get a fox, a chicken, and a sack of corn across a river.
He has a rowboat, and it can only carry him and one other thing.
If the fox and the chicken are left together, the fox will eat the chicken.
If the chicken and the corn are left together, the chicken will eat the corn.


<<Response>>====================================================



The New Puzzle:
A woman needs to get a goat, a wolf, a cabbage, and a basket of apples across a river. She has a canoe that can only carry her and one other thing at a time. She faces the following challenges:
- If the goat and the cabbage are left alone, the goat will eat the cabbage.
- If the wolf and the apples are left alone, the wolf will eat the apples.
- The wolf and the goat can be left together safely (the wolf, being well-fed, has no interest in eating the goat).

The task is to figure out how the woman can get all the animals and items across the river without anything getting eaten.

The Solution:
1. The woman takes the wolf across the river and leaves it on the other side.
2. She returns alone to the original side to get the goat.
3. She takes the goat across the river, but instead of leaving the goat with the wolf, she takes the wolf back with her to the original side.
4. She leaves the wolf on the original side and takes the cabbage across the river to the side where the goat is waiting.
5. She leaves the cabbage with the goat and returns alone to collect the wolf.
6. She takes the wolf across the river again, leaving it with the cabbage. Since the wolf won't eat the cabbage, these are safe together.
7. She then returns to the original side for the last time to get the basket of apples.
8. Finally, she takes the apples across the river. Now, all the items and animals are safely on the other side.

Throughout this process, nothing was left unattended with something it might eat, and everything made it safely across the river.

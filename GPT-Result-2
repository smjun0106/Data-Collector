Puzzle 1:
A woman needs to transport a cat, a mouse, and a block of cheese across a river. The woman has a canoe that can carry only her and one additional item at a time. If the cat is left alone with the mouse, the cat will pounce on the mouse. If the mouse is left with the cheese, it will nibble on the cheese.

Solution:
1. The woman takes the mouse across first and leaves it on the other side of the river.
2. She returns alone and takes the cat across the river next.
3. She leaves the cat on the other side but takes the mouse back with her to the original side.
4. She leaves the mouse on the original side and takes the cheese across the river.
5. She leaves the cheese with the cat and returns to the original side to pick up the mouse.
6. She takes the mouse across the river one last time. Now, all three are safely on the opposite shore.

Puzzle 2:
A scientist must move a carnivorous plant, a frog, and a supply of insects across a lake. The scientist has a motorboat that can carry just the scientist and one other item. If the carnivorous plant is left with the frog, it will try to eat the frog. If the frog is left with the insects, it will consume them.

Solution:
1. The scientist takes the frog across the lake first and leaves it alone.
2. He returns and takes the insects across.
3. He leaves the insects on the far shore but takes the frog back with him to the original side.
4. He then takes the carnivorous plant across the lake.
5. He leaves the carnivorous plant on the far shore and goes back to pick up the frog for the final trip.

Puzzle 3:
A hiker needs to carry a bear cub, a honeycomb full of honey, and a basket of fish across a mountain pass. The hiker has a sled that can hold only the hiker and one other item. If the bear cub is left with the honeycomb, it will eat the honey. If the bear cub is left with the fish, it will eat the fish.

Solution:
1. The hiker transports the honeycomb across the pass first and leaves it there.
2. The hiker returns and takes the bear cub across second.
3. After leaving the bear cub on the other side, the hiker takes the honeycomb back to the starting side.
4. The hiker then leaves the honeycomb at the starting side, takes the basket of fish across, and leaves it with the bear cub, ensuring the bear cub doesn't eat anything since it's now accompanied by the hiker.
5. Finally, the hiker returns to take the honeycomb across the pass. Now everything is safely on the finishing side of the mountain pass.
